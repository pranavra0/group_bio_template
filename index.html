    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Our team's mission is to develop high-quality projects while enhancing our collaboration skills and expanding our knowledge base in software engineering as a whole.</p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrum follows fixed-length Sprints – A Sprint is timeboxed 1 for a week, and once it begins, the scope should not change.</li>
        <li>The Scrum Team consists of three roles – The Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team. There are no sub-teams or hierarchies.</li>
        <li>The Product Backlog is the single source of work – The Product Owner manages and prioritizes it, ensuring it reflects the most valuable work for the team.</li>
        <li>The team is self-organizing – Developers decide how to complete work within a Sprint. The Scrum Master facilitates but does not dictate execution.</li>
        <li>Work must be visible to everyone – The backlog, Sprint progress, and impediments should be transparent through tools like a Scrum board or backlog tracker.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Breaking Honor Code</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As soon as the honor code is broken, the teacher or TAs will be immediately contacted.</li>
        <li>We will leave the punishment up to the school and the teacher as this is a serious matter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Behind Schedule Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Team members concerned about lack of progress should contact the Product Owner or Scrum Master.</li>
        <li>The Scrum Master chooses whether to award a “strike” toward the team member in question (2-strike penalty before they must explain to the group/hold accountability).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Uncooperative Team Member Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If any member misses two meetings, they must provide a reasonable excuse. If no reasonable excuse is provided, they must discuss the situation with TAs or the instructor.</li>
        <li>If a member does not complete work on time, they must provide a reasonable excuse and discuss the situation with TAs or the instructor.</li>
    </ul>
